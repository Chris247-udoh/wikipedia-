      This page sets forth the nuts and bolts of creating a page in any
      namespace â€“ the mechanics of doing so. Please note that only logged in
      users can create pages in non-talk namespaces. This page does not delve
      into the reasons one should or should not create a page, what to consider
      before doing so, nor what content would or would not be appropriate. For a
      more general treatment regarding the DOs and DON'Ts of article creation,
      please see Help:Your first article. For a general introduction to
      contributing, see Wikipedia:Contributing to Wikipedia and consider taking
      a tour through the Wikipedia:Tutorial. For a guided process to create an
      article (and for which these technical instructions will not be needed),
      see the article wizard and Wikipedia:Articles for creation, where a
      proposed article will first be created as a draft and then submitted for
      review before possible "publication" by a move to the article mainspace.

      For relevant considerations before creating an encyclopedia article,
      please see the main notability guideline, our policies on verifiability,
      writing from a neutral point of view, our restrictions on original
      research and our guide to what Wikipedia is not. For styling issues, see
      the manual of style and the article layout guideline. For what title to
      choose for an article, see the article titling policy. You can also create
      a page by entering the page name in the input field below.

    <p>Enter page name</p>
    <input name="text" />
    <h2>How a page is created</h2>
    <p>
      All Wikipedia pages are created by accessing a page title that does not
      yet exist, usually by clicking on a red-colored link (which denotes
      non-existence, as opposed to a blue link which, with some exceptions,
      indicates the linked page exists). Creation is simple: upon clicking a red
      link, you will be transported to a blank page. Once there, enter any text
      and then click the Publish changes button. That's it; the page should have
      been created. Many pages are created after a user sees an existing red
      link on a page, and then follows these steps. The methods explored below
      describe how to access a non-existent page when a red link is not already
      presented to you, in order for you to follow these steps to creation.
    </p>
    <h3>Method 1: searching</h3>
    <p>
      Enter text in the search field that you seek to create as a page title. If
      the title you entered does not already exist, is not technically
      restricted and is not creation protected, the resulting page will i) tell
      you that it does not exist; ii) advise that you can create the page, and
      iii) will provide a red link to the page title. It will normally appear in
      the following form (it may vary depending on the skin you have set): There
      were no results matching the query. You may create the page "Red-linked
      Text You Searched For".
    </p>
     <h4>Method 2: previewing a red link</h4>
     <ol><li>Click edit on any accessible page;</li>
        <li>
            Surround the page title you want to create in doubled brackets, e.g., [[Proposed Title]]</li>
        <li>Click on the red link revealed.</li>
    </ol>
